# FASTENER (FeAture SelecTion ENabled by EntRopy)

## Feature Selection for Highly Dimensional Datasets

In this paper, FASTENER feature selection algorithm is presented.
The algorithm exploits entropy-based measures such as mutual information in the crossover phase of the genetic algorithm approach.
FASTENER converges to an (near) optimal subset of features faster than previous state-of-the-art algorithms and achieves better classification accuracy than similarity-based methods such as KBest or ReliefF or wrapper methods such as POSS.
The approach was evaluated using the Earth Observation dataset for land-cover classification from ESA's Sentinel-2 mission, the digital elevation model and the ground truth data of the Land Parcel Identification System from Slovenia.
The algorithm can be used in any statistical learning scenario.
